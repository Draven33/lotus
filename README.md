## Preamble

I'm [erri120](https://github.com/erri120), one of the [Developers](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/contributors) who work on [Wabbajack](https://https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack). This is both a good and bad reason for having a Modlist up and running:</br>
I compile this Modlist not from the latest release but from the latest commit on the master branch of Wabbajack. This means that you will get pretty fast updates but updates using a Wabbajack that is not even publicly available.

## Main focus of this Modlist

"_Is this Modlist the most graphical intense and beautiful Modlist?_" No.

"_Is it the most realistic?_" Hell no!

"_Does it fix everything?_" Maybe?

"_Is this a base for adding more mods?_" Kinda...

"_What the hell is this and why does this exists?_" Let me explain:

This is a medium Modlist. _What is medium_ you may ask. It is not heavy but also not light. It has re-textures for most but not all textures. It fixes a lot but not all bugs. It can be expanded upon but not with everything you see on the Nexus.

## Installation

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update than you should always check the Changelog for that release before doing anything. Always backup your saves in case anything happens or start anew with the update depending on the changes made.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## In-Game MCM Options

Once you're in the actual game, there are still some MCM options you should configure before starting your playthrough. This is entirely optional but highly recommended since some options can change your game substantially.

### Quick Light

Change _Set light key_ to whatever you prefer. Pressing this key for the time specified at _Long press time for activate key_ will give you a light source to illuminate the darkness.

Mod: [Quick Light SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12633)

### Nemesis PCEA

This menu lets you enable/disable player only animations. The _0Female_ and _1Male_ are from the [Realistic Animation Project - Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77343) mod which I ported to SSE. I highly recommend you check the animations for whatever gender your character is.

Mod: [Project New Reign - Nemesis PCEA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31667)

### SSSO

SSSO aka _Skyrim SafeSave System Overhaul_ lets you change the way autosaves work. Do note that the _Manual Save key_ is set to _ESC_ meaning _none_ at the start. The default values are fine but you can spice up your playthrough with the _Enable hardcore Mode_ and _Enforced hardcore mode_ if you want.

Mod: [Skyrim SafeSave System Overhaul - Rotating save and optional Hardcore mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19399)

## Important Mods you should know about

This section contains information about some of the most important mods in this Modlist. If you want to add more mods (see [Adding more mods](#adding-more-mods)) than take a look at this section for maximum compatibility.

### CBBE

Since the dawn of mankind, we asked the question _CBBE or UNP?_. This Modlist utilizes the newest addition to the Skyrim Special Edition Modding Community: [CBBE 3BBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174). As you can probably guess from the name, this is built upon CBBE and can be categorized as a CBBE mod. If you want to add any mod and can choose between different body types, make sure you select CBBE.

CBBE 3BBB has the ability to swap between HDT-SMP and CBPC physics on the fly using a power. I have installed CBBE 3BBB with the _Full SMP_ option meaning that you will get _the most physics_ when using HDT-SMP. Do note that HDT-SMP can be resource hungry (especially on the CPU) so compare the FPS of both options to see what works best for you.

- [CBPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224)

### Nemesis

[Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main) and [Nemesis PCEA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31667) got added pretty late into this Modlist. In case you have no idea what Nemesis is: Nemesis is, in a nut shell, a replacement for [FNIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038) and Nemesis PCEA is a direct replacement for [FNIS PCEA2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13281). This means that you can't have both installed.

### Cathedral Mods

"_The [Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19515) is a comprehensive visual overhaul for Skyrim. It is performance friendly, consisting mostly of re-textures, improved models, and lighting modifications, so that you can use it as a foundation without having to worry extensively about compatibility_". - Introduction for the Cathedral mods

I choose to use most of the Cathedral mods in this Modlist for the reasons above. The most important one you need to watch out for is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791). This is the weather mod for the Modlist and if you want to swap out the ENB, than you need one that is compatible with this weather mod.

## Adding more mods

**Read the [Important Mods you should know about](#important-mods-you-should-know-about) sections first**

If you want to add more mods to this setup than I'm glad you have found your way here. Do note that adding mods to any Modlist, not marked as **modular** or **expandable**, requires decent enough knowledge about modding and working with tools like [xEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit), [zEdit](https://github.com/z-edit/zedit) and [Mator Smash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90987).

### Textures

Probably the most easiest type of mods you can add to any setup. The only thing you need to look out for are LODs.

### Outfits

This Modlist uses [CBBE 3BBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) as its body so make sure you download outfits made for CBBE. Since [HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872) and [CBPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224) are both installed, you can also install and use outfits marked with _Physics_.

### Animations

[Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main) has a similar workflow like [FNIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038):

1) Install the mod with new Animations
2) Open Nemesis
3) Check for any Patches you might need to add
4) Click _Update Engine_ (may take a while)
5) Click _Launch Nemesis Behavior Engine_ (may also take some time)

If you want to add _Player only_ animations, checkout [Nemesis PCEA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31667).

### ENB

The weather mod used in this Modlist is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791) and the lighting mod is [Luminosity Lighting Overhaul - The Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16830) (see [Cathedral Mods](#cathedral-mods)). If you want to swap out the ENB, make sure that it is compatible with Cathedral Weathers and looks somewhat decent with Luminosity. You could try and swap the those two mods with any other weather + lighting mod but this may disrupt the visual consistency that the entire Cathedral lineup has.

## Removing the Modlist from your System

Since we are using MO2 as our Mod Manager the removal of this Modlist is very simple. Remove the MO2 folder and you're done. Of course there are still your save files in the documents folder and your game folder still contains SKSE and the ENB. I recommend using the [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) to remove the enb leftovers from your game folder.

To uninstall SKSE, remove all files starting with `skse64_*`.

## Contact

While I'm always available on the [Wabbajack Discord]([https://](https://discord.gg/wabbajack)), I would advise checking the [Issues](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/issues) on GitHub first if you have any problems. Since messages in Discord can get buried very quickly, you should also post _Enhancements_ or _Feature Requests_ in the [Issues](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/issues) tracker.
