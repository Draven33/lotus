## Preamble

**This Modlist contains mods with sexual content and you need to be of legal age in your country (most western countries: 18+, some eastern ones: 21+)**.

I'm [erri120](https://github.com/erri120), one of the [Developers](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/contributors) behind [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack) and a modding veteran for ~[7 years](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/6672467).
As a professional scientist in the field of extreme indulgence in bodily pleasures and the manifestation thereof in video games, I have decided to create a Modlist involving said sinful acts of debauchery.

Now for real: If you want a fully featured and functional Modlist that is playable from start to finish, containing multiple quest, overhauls and sexual mods than you've come to the right GitHub repository.

## Requirements

- [Nexus Premium Account](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/store/category/1-premium-membership/)
- [LoversLab Account](https://www.loverslab.com/)
- A brain, eyes and time to read through this README

### System Specs

CPU: >= 7th gen Intel processor OR >= AMD Ryzen 3000 series processor
GPU: >= 1060, you need at least 6GB of VRAM
RAM: >= DDR4 with at least 16GBs

Everything should be installed on an SSD that has at least 256GB of space available.

## Installation

### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Steam Config

##### Disable the Steam Overlay

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the _General_ tab and un-tick the _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ checkbox.

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/`.

#### Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the _Options_ menu.

1) Click on _Ultra_
2) Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
3) Set _Antialiasing_ to _Off_
4) Uncheck _Windowed Mode_ and _Borderless_

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation. Grab the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/releases). You will find `Lotus.wabbajack`, `CHANGELOG.pdf` and `README.pdf`.

Download the release to a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in the _working folder_.

#### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1) Open Wabbajack
2) Load the Modlist from Disk
3) Adjust the download and installation paths
4) Click the Go/Begin button
5) Wait for Wabbajack to finish

##### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you loose no progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

### Post-Installation

## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update, than you should check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## Important Mods you should know about

This section contains information about some of the most important mods in this setup. I made this section so end-users know exactly what mods change what and can read-up on stuff they find interesting as well as give props to the mod authors.

### SexLab - Frameworks

You know this would be first, didn't you...
[SexLab Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/91861-sexlab-framework-se-163-beta-8-november-22nd-2019/) is the core of all installed LL mods. Do note that this is a **beta build**. [SLAL](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5328-sexlab-animation-loader-sse/) or _SexLab Animation Loader_ and [SexLab Aroused Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5482-sexlab-aroused-redux-sse-version-29/) are included as well.

Since we don't judge your fetishes, I have included [Creature Framework](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5462-creature-framework-se/) and [More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/).

[Devious Devices](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5878-devious-devices-se-beta/) sadly does not work for SSE **yet**, but once that is around, it will of course be included.

[ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) is a requirement for other mods and I have included the [ZAZ 8.0+ UUNP HDT Rev3](https://mega.nz/#!7ZQjmABY!5slFVs_5YB7DphHCrd2m1nzDTiIwpFoLyRKq6WUt6ek) version.

### BakaFactory

`BakaFactory`/`factoryclose`/`바보공장` is the creator of many mods used in this setup. I **highly recommend** checking out the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/BaboFactory) page and [Discord](https://discord.gg/gbHGCgB) server.

### SexLab - Animations

[More Nasty Critters](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/) and [ZAZ](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/) already come with some animations, but I have expanded upon that with [BakaFactory's SLAL Animation](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6707-bakafactorys-slal-animation-le-sse/) and [Psyche Animation](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11477-psyche-animation-lesse/).

Links:

- [More Nasty Critters Special Edition 12.01](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5464-more-nasty-critters-special-edition/)
- [ZAZ Animation Packs for SE 1.0.0](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5957-zaz-animation-packs-for-se/)

- [Psyche Animation (LE/SSE) 1.0.5](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/11477-psyche-animation-lesse/)

### SexLab - Gameplay

All those animations and features from the frameworks need to be used somewhere. A lot of big quest mod are still not converted and it will take some time for LL to make the switch to SSE. That being said, the _biggest_ quest mod in this setup is [From The Deeps](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8663-from-the-deeps-for-sse/). Ask innkeepers for some rumors to pick up this lovecraft-like story! [Amorous Adventures](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/109518-amorous-adventures-34-sse-for-lovers-lab/) is also included, because it's funny. [Bestial Essence](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10036-bestial-essence-se/) and [Sexlab Beastess](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9904-sexlab-beastess-sse-port/) for all beast lovers. (I changed SL Beastess substantially and nerfed almost all effects to make it playable)

The vanilla quests are not being left alone! [SexLab Solutions](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10742-sexlab-solutions-revisited-se/) will offer additional dialog that may lead to some _interesting_ outcomes.

If you want some _wholesomeness_ than take a look at the included [Spouses Enhanced](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5266-spouses-enhanced-se/). This mod features no _extreme_ content. The focus is the relationship between two consenting, married adults.

The complete opposite of wholesome are [Defeat](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9152-sexlab-defeat-sse/), [Simple Slavery](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6535-simple-slavery-plus-se/) and [Radiant Prostitution](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10046-radiant-prostitutiongigolo-se/). Do note that I am using [Sexlab Defeat Baka Edition](https://www.patreon.com/posts/32912602) instead of normal Defeat.

[Sexlab Approach Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8077-sexlab-approach-redux-by-bakafactory-le-se) uses the new keywords of [SexLabAroused Redux Modified by BakaFactory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SlvS2KRY6UscQisro8GEskwCCKg4Wa3G/view) to cure the blindness of all NPCs around you. From the mod page:

> Now when certain conditions are met, npcs will chase after you and ask something. Some of them are after solidifying a friendship or some of them are just after your sexy body and want to have sex with you. Sometimes these chasings get messy and the relationship can be broken at some point. And they will hate you, or they will even attempt to rape you.
> Now what are you gonna do? Accept their offers without hesitation, which will make you vulnerable and then it makes you let them enjoy your body regardless of your will? Or will you decline every each one of them and act like an asshole? An aggressive, stubborn girl would do that. But they will hate you at the end and they are highly likely to try to rape you. It could be way more complicated when you are pretty.

Do note that this mod is female-oriented. [Sexlab Approach Redux for HIM](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10074-sexlab-approach-redux-for-him-se/) exists but I have yet to include it.

[SexLab Deadly Drain](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9905-sexlab-deadly-drain-sse-port/) is for all succubus lovers. This mod works for any gender and you do not have to be a Vampire or Succubus. I found this to be the most compatible succubus like mod.

### SexLab - Others

The following mods have a more _supportive_ role and do not fit any of the other categories.

[Sexlab LightMeUp](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8275-sexlab-lightmeup/) will illuminate the current SexLab scene so you don't have to pull out any additional torches and can actually see whats happening.

[Wet Function Redux](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9467-wet-function-redux-se/) and [Blush When Aroused](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10774-blush-when-aroused-se/) add some extra effects when certain conditions are met.

[Wintersun - SexLab Integration](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10796-wintersun-sexlab-integration-se/) provides a bridge between SL and [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506).

[ViVi's Beastess Lairs](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9932-vivis-beastess-lairs-se/) adds new player homes all around Skyrim in form of caves.

[Equipable Horse Cocks](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/9903-sos-equipable-horse-cocks-sse-port/) because the SL strap-on sucks (I have created COBJs so you can craft them).

### Music

I could not help but to include my favorite Skyrim music mod: [Yggdrasil Music and SoundFX Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21578). It's lore-friendly Dark Folk (Nordic) music which may not really fit this Modlist but I fucking love it so here you go.

[Dreams and Nightmares](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25416), another mod adding dark and melancholic exploration tracks.

### Cathedral Mods

"_The [Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19515) is a comprehensive visual overhaul for Skyrim. It is performance friendly, consisting mostly of re-textures, improved models, and lighting modifications, so that you can use it as a foundation without having to worry extensively about compatibility._" - Introduction for the Cathedral mods

I choose to use most of the Cathedral mods in this Modlist for the reasons above. The most important one you need to watch out for is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791). This is the weather mod for the Modlist and if you want to swap out the ENB, than you need one that is compatible with this weather mod.

- [Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19515)(unreleased)
- [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791)
- [Majestic Mountains - Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052)
- [Landscapes - Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21954)
- [Luminosity Lighting Overhaul - The Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16830)
- [8K Night Skies - Stars and Galaxies - Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20301)
- [Cathedral Water Overhaul - Includes Water Edge Bug Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22962)

### ENB: Silent Horizon

ENBs for Special Edition never really convinced me. [SnowFall Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79335) singlehandedly made me stay with Oldrim for 3 years since it came out. I choose [Silent Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543) for this Modlist, mainly because of its performance and set of features. It is also compatible with [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791), the weather mod of this list.

If you have a Titan V and more FPS than you need, check the [ENB](#enb) section for ENBs you can swap to.

## In-Game MCM Options

## Adding more Mods

### ENB

The weather mod used in this Modlist is [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791) and the lighting mods are [Luminosity Lighting Overhaul - The Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16830) (see [Cathedral Mods](#cathedral-mods)) and [Enhanced Lighting for ENB (ELE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1377). If you want to swap out the ENB, make sure that it is compatible with Cathedral Weathers and looks somewhat decent with Luminosity and ELE. You could try and swap the those two mods with any other weather + lighting mod but this may disrupt the visual consistency that the entire Cathedral lineup has.

Other ENBs you can use (not tested, experience may vary):

ENBs that work with Cathedral Weathers:

- [Silent Horizon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543)
- [Ljoss - Semi-realistic performance preset with Nighteye and ENB Light support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30971)

ENBs that maybe work with Cathedral Weathers:

- [Rudy ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4796)
- [NVT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11203)
- [PRT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)
- [Apex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18042)

## Tweaking Performance

My Setup:

- i7-7700k running at ~4.6 GHz
- 1060 6GB OC to ~1800MHz
- 16GB DDR4-3200 RAM
- Game and MO2 running on an SSD

### Tweaking the ENB

This should always be the first thing you tweak. Disabling the ENB entirely can give you anything from 20 to >70 FPS. The ENB this Modlist comes with (see [ENB: Silent Horizon](#enb-silent-horizon)) is rather performance friendly. Open the ENB GUI using `Right Shift + Enter` (`Right Shift` is under the `Enter` key). This will open up the ENB GUI where you can enable and disable certain effects in the left panel.

- `Bloom`: Can give you up to 3 FPS, will make light sources less bright
- `DepthOfField`: Can give you up to 10 FPS, disabled by default and not really suited for gameplay
- `Ambient Occlusion`: This one is a big hitter. You can get up to 20 FPS by disabling this but the effect is very noticeable
- `Distant/DetailedShadow`: Those two can really give you a lot of FPS back depending on your shader settings (game settings). They are very noticeable.
- `ComplexFire/ParticleLights`: You won't see a lot of difference at first when disabling those two, but when particles are on screen (eg using magic or near light sources such as fires), they can _burn_ through your FPS

### Tweaking the Game Settings

I highly recommend using [BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875) which is included in this Modlist (can be found in `MO2/tools/BethINI`). I recommend tweaking the `Detail` section for more FPS:

- `Shadow Resolution`: Very big one. A good balance is `2048` which is the borderline between high FPS drainage and garbage looking shadows.
- `Ambient Occlusion`: Highly recommended to leave this at `None`. The ENB this Modlist comes with, uses the ENB SAO which is 10x better and performance friendly than base game SAO.
- `Detailed Draw Distance`: Maybe try `2000` instead of `2800` but you won't notice a lot of FPS gain (maybe 1-3)
- `Remove Shadows`: If you really struggle, use this. This will disable all Shadows (not recommended)

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Contact

While I'm always available on the [Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack), I would advise checking the [Issues](https://github.com/erri120/lotus/issues) (open **and** closed ones) on GitHub first if you have any problems. The same goes for _Enhancements_ or _Feature/Mod Requests_.
