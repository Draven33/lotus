**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem. I highly recommend opening the console and clicking on the object that has a bug. If your bug is location based, use the book from this mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30907.

**Did you add any additional mods?**

**Save file**
In some cases it's useful to upload and link a save file so I can quickly jump into the game and check the bug. You don't need to do this in most cases but problems with quests or scripts can be better debugged with a save file before it happened.
