## Updating the README

Recommended Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Use the recommended extensions (VS Code will automatically tell you). Can also be found [here](.vscode/extensions.json).

Since everything is in Markdown, you should know how to use that. [Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a good Markdown Cheatsheet and most of the time the extensions will report problems.
